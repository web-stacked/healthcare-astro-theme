## What To Customize First

If you are adapting this theme for a real site, these are the highest-impact changes:

1. Replace the demo brand content in `src/data/navigation.json`
2. Update page text in `src/pages/`
3. Swap the bundled images in `src/assets/`
4. Edit brand and contact details in `src/data/navigation.json`
5. Adjust colors and spacing tokens in `src/styles/tailwind.css`

## Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev
npm run check
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Customization

For a full walkthrough, see [CUSTOMIZATION.md](CUSTOMIZATION.md).

Common edits you will likely make first:

1. Update the branding and navigation in `src/data/navigation.json`
2. Replace the images in `src/assets/`
3. Edit the page copy in `src/pages/`
4. Update brand and contact details in `src/data/navigation.json`
5. Adjust colors, spacing, and design tokens in `src/styles/tailwind.css`
6. Replace `public/favicon.svg` and `src/assets/logo.png`

The theme is intentionally simple to edit without needing a CMS, adapter, or backend setup.

The included contact form is a front-end demo. Connect it to your preferred form provider before deploying a production site. You should also confirm that every bundled image is suitable for your intended use or replace the images with your own licensed assets.
